# Tiny Assistant

Tiny Assistant is an LLM-based assistant that runs on your Pebble smartwatch,
if you still have a smartwatch that ceased production in 2016 lying around.

## Usage

### Server

To use Tiny Assistant, you will need to run the server in `service/` somewhere
your phone can reach.

You will also need to set a few environment variables:

- `GEMINI_KEY` - a key for Google's Gemini - you can get one at the
  [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
- `REDIS_URL` - a URL for a functioning Redis server. No data is persisted
  long-term, so a purely in-memory server is fine.
- `USER_IDENTIFICATION_URL` - a URL pointing to an instance of
  [user-identifier](https://github.com/pebble-dev/user-identifier).
- `MAPBOX_KEY` - an API key for [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com), which is
  used for geocoding. If no key is provided, geocoding will be unavailable.

### Client

Update the URL in `app/src/pkjs/urls.js` to point at your instance of the
server.

Then you can simply build it using the Pebble SDK and install on your watch.
